## 1. Unemployment in the US

Try to replicate the following line chart that displays the evolution in the unemployment rate in the US over time. The challenge here consists of overlaying a set of shaded boxes in red or blue, depending on the party to which the president in power at the time belongs. To help with that part, you can see below how to create a data frame with the relevant information.

```{r}

# Creating a dataframe with the unemployment data
unemp <- read.csv("data/unemployment.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Creating a data frame with the background colour information
name <- c("Truman", "Eisenhower", "Kennedy", "Johnson", "Nixon",
        "Ford", "Carter", "Reagan", "Bush I", "Clinton", "Bush II",
        "Obama")
start <- as.Date(c("1948-01-01", "1953-01-20", "1961-01-20", "1963-11-22",
        "1969-01-20", "1974-08-09", "1977-01-20", "1981-01-20",
        "1989-01-20", "1993-01-20", "2001-01-20", "2009-01-20"))
end <- c(start[-1], as.Date("2016-10-01"))
party <- c("D", "R", "D", "D", "R", "R", "D", "R", "R", "D", "R", "D")
pres <- data.frame(name, start, end, party, stringsAsFactors=F)


```

Your code here:

```{r}

```

Solution:

```{r}

# Transform date column to datetime
unemp$date <- as_date(unemp$date)

yrng <- range(unemp$unemp, na.rm=TRUE)
xrng <- range(unemp$date, na.rm=TRUE)

pq <- ggplot(unemp) + geom_line(aes(x=date, y=unemp))

pq

# Fixing axes so that background covers entire plot
pq <- pq + 
  geom_rect(data=pres, 
            aes(xmin=start, xmax=end,
                fill=party), 
            ymin=yrng[1]-0.05, ymax=yrng[2]+0.05) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c("blue", "red"), 0.2)) +
  scale_x_date(limits=xrng, expand=c(0,0))

pq

# Adding president names
pq <- pq + 
  geom_text(data=pres, 
            aes(x=start, y=yrng[2], label=name),
    size=3, hjust=0.25, vjust=1.25, angle=90) 

# Adding lines to separate presidencies
pq <- pq + geom_vline(data=pres, aes(xintercept=as.numeric(start)),
    color="grey50", linetype=5, size=0.5)

pq

# Finally, moving legend and removing x axis title
library(grid)
pq <- pq + theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.margin = unit(-1, "cm") ) +
    scale_fill_manual("Party of President", 
        values=alpha(c("blue", "red"), 0.2),
        labels= c("Democratic", "Republican"))

pq

# Adjusting y axis
pq <- pq + 
  scale_y_continuous("Unemployment Rate", labels = percent,
            limits = c(0.02, 0.115), breaks=c(0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10, 0.12)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0.02, 0.12))


pq
```

## 2. Interactive 3D plots

A great package to create interactive and 3D plots is `plotly`. Use this documentation [here](https://plotly.com/r/3d-scatter-plots/) as a starting point. Then create a 3D plot using the sample of public Facebook posts with the following features:

- Restrict the sample to only posts with >= 5000 likes 
- x-axis: Log of likes count
- y-axis: Log of shares count
- z-axis: Length of the message (create a new column with the `str_count` function)
- Colour coding of points: Party

Judging approximately from the figure, which party writes the longest posts in this sub sample? Which party has most likes and shares?

Reading in the data and some initial processing:

```{r}
df <- read.csv("data/fb-congress-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Transform date column to datetime
df$date <- as_date(df$date)

# Dropping some very uncommon post types
nrow(df)
df <- df %>%
  filter(!post_type %in% c("music", "note"))
nrow(df)
```

Creating the plot data:

```{r}
df_plot <- as_tibble(df[df$likes_count > 5000,])
df_plot$message_length <- str_count(df_plot$message)
df_plot <- df_plot %>% select(likes_count, shares_count, message_length, party)
df_plot$likes_count <- log(df_plot$likes_count)
df_plot$shares_count <- log(df_plot$shares_count)
df_plot$party <- as.factor(df_plot$party)
```

Animated 3D plot:

```{r}
fig <- plot_ly(df_plot, x = ~likes_count, y = ~shares_count, z = ~message_length, color = ~party)
fig <- fig %>% add_markers()
fig <- fig %>% layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = "Log likes count"),
                     yaxis = list(title = "Log shares count"),
                     zaxis = list(title = "Message length")))
fig
```


## 3. Interactive gg-plots

`plotly` can also make a range of ggplot plots interactive by using ggplot objects as input in the `ggplotly` function:

```{r}
p <- ggplot(df[df$likes_count>0 & df$comments_count>0,], 
        aes(x=likes_count, y = comments_count))
p <- p + geom_hex() + scale_x_log10(labels = comma) + scale_y_log10(labels = comma) + 
    scale_fill_continuous()

# Creating an animated plot
ggplotly(p)
```

Note that this will work less well with sophisticated plots that have a lot of features like the plot you created in part 1.
